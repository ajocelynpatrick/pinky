This program requires the wxWidgets libraries, which includes the
wx-config utility. The wx-config utility is used to tell us which flags
we should pass to the compiler, and which flags we should pass to the
linker; they are many, so the utility solves this problem elegantly.

Aparently, however, we cannot run this utility on your computer. This
problem is likely caused because the program is not in your PATH
environment variable or because you just don't have the program --- and
you, therefore, probably never installed the wxWidgets libraries. 

To compile this program, please do exactly one of the following: (1)
make sure that ``which'' can find wx-config, (2) run wx-config --libs
--cxxflags and add the output to the first line of conf-wx, (3) write
the flags yourself in the first line of conf-wx.

Then say ``make'' again. Then ``make install.''
