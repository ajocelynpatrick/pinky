(*) Introduction

The name of this program is Pinky. Pinky is going to be a chess
interface for FICS. Initially, we need to get all the elements of the
interface ready; then we will implement the network functionality. If
you're interested in working in the network part of Pinky, look up
``FICS style 12'' which is the protocol we will be using to talk to
FICS. See

(*) Pieces 

The pieces are currently not the original ones; we will draw original
pieces for a public release. They're currently 44x44 pixels. In
production, 

(*) Namespaces

I suppose we should be wrapping the whole application around a
namespace; I will do this soon. If you have experience, go ahead.

(*) Picking a square

When the user clicks on a square, we capture the coordinates of the
click --- call them (x,y). To discover which square was clicked, we
round x down to the nearest multiple of f --- for example, f = 50
pixels, the size of a square. For y, we round it up to the nearest
multiple of f. So the left corner of the clicked square is

                        ((x/f) * f, (y/f) * f).

Having the square, we draw a frame around the square. The frame is drawn
by changing the devices's brush to wxTRANSPARENT, since we only care
about the border of the square. To set the color of the frame, we change
the pen of the device from black to red. 

We need to improve the painting of the border to something stronger
looking.
